## DNA Search
A nucleotide is a building block of nucleic acids. Such nucleotides consist of a sugar molecule attached to a nitrogen containing base. The four possible DNA bases are _(adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T))_. In programs, these bases are represented as characters. A letter can be thought to represent a nucleotide and a certain combination of three nucleotides is named a **codon**. A codon thus is a sequence which corresponds to a specific amino acid.

It is common to want to search for a specific codon in a gene (comprised of the DNA bases).
